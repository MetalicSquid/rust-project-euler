# rust-project-euler
Rust based solutions to Project Euler.

I am trying to solve the problems by only using the standard library and no external crates or other libraries.

## Disclaimer:
This repository contains potential answers to the Project Euler mathematical/programming based challanges. You should not use these answers as a method of answering the questions to get meaningless internet points - that's cheating. 

### Solved:
- [x] 1 - [Multiples of 3 and 5.](multiples_of_3_and_5-1)
- [x] 2 - [Even fibonacci numbers.](even_fibonacci_numbers-2)
- [x] 3 - [Largest prime factor.](largest_prime_factor-3)
- [x] 4 - [Largest palindrome product.](largest_palindrome_product-4)
- [x] 5 - [Smallest multiple.](smallest_multiple-5)
- [x] 6 - [Sum square difference.](sum_square_difference-6)
- [x] 7 - [10001st prime.](I0001st_prime-7)
- [x] 8 - [Largest product in a series.](largest_product_in_a_series-8)
- [x] 9 - [Special pythagorean triplet.](special_pythagorean_triplet-9)
- [x] 10 - [Summation of primes.](summation_of_primes-10) REFACTOR - I think it took roughly 10 mins.
- [ ] 11 - [Largest product in a grid.](largest_product_in_a_grid-11)
- [ ] 12 - [Highly divisible triangular number.](highly_divisible_triangular_number-12)
- [x] 13 - [Large sum.]()
- [x] 14 - [Longest Collatz sequence.]()
- [ ] 15 - [Lattice paths.]()
- [ ] 16 - [Power digit sum.]()
- [x] 17 - [Number letter counts.]()
- [ ] 18 - [Maximum path sum I.]() - Very close.
- [ ] 19 - [Counting sundays.]()
- [ ] 20 - [Factorial digit sum.]()
- [x] 21 - [Amicable numbers.]()
- [ ] 22 - [Names scores.]()
- [ ] 23 - [Non-abundant sums.]()
