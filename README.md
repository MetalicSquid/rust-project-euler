# rust-project-euler
Rust based solutions to Project Euler.

I am trying to solve the problems by only using the standard library and no external crates or other libraries.

## Disclaimer:
This repository contains potential answers to the Project Euler mathematical/programming based challanges. You should not use these answers as a method of answering the questions to get meaningless internet points - that's cheating. 

### Solved:
- [x] 1 - Multiples of 3 and 5.   
- [x] 2 - Even fibonacci numbers.
- [x] 3 - Largest prime factor. 
- [x] 4 - Largest palindrome product.
- [x] 5 - Smallest multiple.
- [x] 6 - Sum square difference.
- [x] 7 - 10001st prime.
- [x] 8 - Largest product in a series.
- [x] 9 - Special pythagorean triplet. 
- [x] 10 - Summation of primes. REFACTOR - I think it took roughly 10 mins.
- [ ] 11 - Largest product in a grid.
- [ ] 12 - Highly divisible triangular number.
- [x] 13 - Large sum.
- [x] 14 - Longest Collatz sequence.
- [ ] 15 - Lattice paths.
- [ ] 16 - Power digit sum.
- [x] 17 - Number letter counts.
