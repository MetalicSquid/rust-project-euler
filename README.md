Rust based solutions to Project Euler.

# Disclaimer:
This repository contains potential answers to the Project Euler mathematical/programming based challanges. You should not use these answers as a method of answering the questions to get meaningless internet points - that's cheating. 

# Solved:
[x] 1 - Multiples of 3 and 5.   
[x] 2 - Even fibonacci numbers.
[x] 3 - Largest prime factor. 
[x] 4 - Largest palindrome product.
[x] 5 - Smallest multiple.
[x] 6 - Sum square difference.
[x] 7 - 10001st prime.
[x] 8 - Largest product in a series.
[x] 9 - Special pythagorean triplet. 
[x] 10 - Summation of primes. REFACTOR - I think it took roughly 10 mins.
